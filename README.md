# Chatbot-CS310
This is the final project for CS 310 - Machine Intelligence. 


`Chatbot-CS310` is a desktop chatbot application. This repository
contains all the files related to creating and implementing the application. The
application can be built from scratch using the files in this repository.

There are two steps involved in starting the application:
* Navigate to the folder Chatbot-CS310 using the command `cd Chatbot-CS310/Code`.
* If you don't have the python modules (scikit-learn, nltk, textblob, and tkinter), then make sure you install those libraries first.
* Use the command `python3 gui.py` to start the chatbot application.
